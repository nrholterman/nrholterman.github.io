☛ Welcome to my website designed for and inspired by [HIST 698](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-methods/index.html).

*Unfortunately, this site is no longer live and will not be updated again. It lives on as an archived remnant, as an repository adding to my digital footprint*

Instead, you can visit me [here](https://nicholasholterman.com) and say hello!
