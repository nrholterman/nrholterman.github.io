Welcome to my website for HIST 698!

This is where I'm sharing ideas, trying out new designs, and developing personal ways to incorporate digital humanities into my studies. Of course, I am a student first and a scholar second, so I wanted to claim a caveat and say that whatever appears on this site is a work in progress and is far from a polished, finished product. It is my goal to keep this website updated and current. Take a look around and enjoy!
