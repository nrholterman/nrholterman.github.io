Welcome to my website for HIST 698!

This is where I'm sharing ideas, trying out new designs, and developing personal ways to incorporate digital humanities into my studies. Of course, I am a student first and a scholar second, so I wanted to claim a caveat and say that whatever appears on this site is a work in progress and is far from a polished, finished product. It is my goal to keep this website updated and current. Take a look around and enjoy!

Until I have some more pertinent things to say, please enjoy this little excerpt from the foreword of *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* by J.R.R. Tolkein:  

"*The Lord of the Rings* has been read by many people since it finally
appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to
the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning
the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a
tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the
attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite
them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is
appealing or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault.
Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it
boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I
have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they
evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed
my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a
long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at
the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the
passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially
approved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects,
minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review
the book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except
one that has been noted by others: the book is too short."
