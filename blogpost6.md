Mining for Literary Gold
9 March 2017


My first exposure to text mining was in my first year as a graduate student in the English department at the University of Texas at Austin. We were in our pro-seminar, methodologies course and talking about Franco Moretti, whom I had heard of before, but didn’t know too much about other than the usual complaint about his obsession with big data. We were talking about his work in conjunction with the voluminous tomes of Victorian England and how text mining was a really “useful” tool when trying to analyze change in language use over time. This reminded me of the moment in Ted Underwood’s post “Seven ways humanists are using computers to understand text,” when he says that text mining for certain words in order to read in the affective romanticism set forth in Wordworth’s poetry can be, well, fraught. It seems unlikely, or at least dubious, that measuring the occurrence of one or several words in a text can really tell us all that much about the work itself, other than the author’s proclivity for using that word. I will admit that while I will search through a stanza or a paragraph for repeated words, it seems to be a whole different beast.

Perhaps it’s because I’m a medievalist that I’m somewhat skeptical of text mining. It could be that because I work with dual-facing translations of medieval works (ranging from Latin, French, and English, and sometimes all three), or it could be that edition I work from can be from one manuscript or from several, that I resist the idea of using words’ occurrences as a basis for investigating a text. That being said, I can absolutely see the utility of text mining, or at least the interest it garners, for works of literatures after the advent of printing. I apologize for periodizing, but I think that there’s something to be said about printed texts (not that there was anything close to uniform orthography after the printing press).

Just because I think text mining is less appropriate for medieval texts, it would be really interesting to use the mining, much like the project creators for “Mining the *Dispatch*,” in order to see a trend over time and geographic space. One particular way I’m thinking about this, for medieval texts, is by taking into consideration Paul Zumthor’s *mouvance*. If there were a way to compile all of the ms. editions for one particular text, and create a data set for provenance, orthographic variation, date of creation, and material, we could potentially trace the factors involved—other than scribal error—in textual variance.

One way to achieve my project is absolutely through the use of OCR. Unfortunately for me, OCR correctors or normalizers don’t really exist for medieval script. The reasons behind this are various and sundry, but it is likely, once again, that the dividing factor here is once again is printing. It would be difficult to normalize texts when many hands are involved in the creation and editing of any one manuscript, and each manuscript can contain a bunch of linguistic variations and oddities; not to mention, again, that they mss. I work on are not written in English and are heavily abbreviated. So, while I get really excited to hear about “semi-decent” normalizers or correctors for 18th-century texts, or even early modern printed texts, it’s frustrating that one of the biggest problems an 18th-century work in OCR is the long S. (Also, I can imagine my friend and colleague Paula Curtis agreeing with me, and probably feeling more adamantly, about the lack of OCR programs available for non-English medieval texts, especially since she works with medieval Japanese sources.
So, to wrap up, I think that text mining is a really cool thing to investigate, and I believe that it can bring new understanding to texts that close reading cannot. For book historians, too, I can imagine it being a great resource. For me, I think text mining would be useful in the future when I inevitably move into the Early Modern period and start looking at different texts. Specifically, my interest in travel narrative might be an interesting starting point for investigating words and their frequency and usage. At this point, however, I’m hard pressed to see any easy, feasible, and in many ways, useful advantages to mining the texts that I work with. As is the case with anything, however, we shall see where I end up, and I am certainly open to trying new methods.
