I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Located in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, my research centers on medieval French literature, with an emphasis on travel narratives, Anglo-Norman, borders around Britain, and gender and sexuality.

Je suis étudiant de troisième cycle à l'Université de Michigan.
