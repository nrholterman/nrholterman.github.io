I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Located in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, my research centers on medieval French literature, with an emphasis on travel narratives, Anglo-Norman, borders around Britain, and gender and sexuality.

Originally, I come from Albany, NY, but I have lived in Montréal, France, and, most recently, Austin, TX. Outside of my studies, I am an avid runner and Netflix marathoner. If you are more interested in my academic pursuits, however, head over to my "Curriculm Vitæ" page and feast your eyes upon some of my achievements.
